    "\n",
    "* Numeric Data Selection: The code snippet selects only the columns with numeric data types (float64 and int64) from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correlation Matrix: It calculates the correlation coefficients between all pairs of numeric columns in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Correlation Values: The resulting correlation matrix provides insights into how variables are related to each other, ranging from -1 to 1.\n",

    "## Explaining Seaborn Heatmap Visualization in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this explanation, we will delve into how to create a heatmap visualization using Seaborn in Python. Heatmaps are powerful tools for visualizing data, especially when dealing with correlation matrices or any dataset where relationships between variables need to be highlighted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heatmaps, a popular visualization technique, use color gradients to represent data values in a matrix format. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The sns.heatmap() function in Seaborn is used to create heatmap visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided code snippet imports Seaborn as sns and then calls the heatmap() function with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* corr: This variable likely holds a correlation matrix or a 2D array of data that will be visualized in the heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "* annot=True: This parameter adds numerical annotations to the heatmap cells, displaying the actual data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* cbar=True: It includes a color bar alongside the heatmap to indicate the mapping of values to colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* cmap='coolwarm': This parameter sets the color palette for the heatmap. In this case, it uses the 'coolwarm' color map, which transitions from cool (blue) to warm (red) colors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "* By utilizing Seaborn's sns.heatmap() function, you can easily generate visually appealing and informative heatmap visualizations in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Remember to provide the correlation matrix or data array you want to visualize, and customize the appearance of the heatmap using parameters like annot, cbar, and cmap to suit your specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Heatmaps are excellent tools for exploring and presenting data relationships in a clear and intuitive manner.\n"
